# RFM Customer Segmentation & Cohort Analysis Project & Unsupervised ML Customer Segmentation

In this project:

- Learn what is RFM analysis and how to apply it
- Perform customer segmentation using clustering algorithms
- Improve skills in data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis  
- Conduct cohort analysis

## Project Overview

This project uses the Online Retail dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains transactions from an UK-based online retail store between December 2010 - December 2011.

## Project Objectives

- Do exploratory data analysis and data visualization to understand the dataset
- Perform descriptive analysis to clean noise and missing values  
- Analyze order, customer, and country distributions
- Conduct RFM analysis on UK transactions
- Segment customers using RFM and unsupervised clustering 
- Compare manual and algorithmic customer segmentation
- Perform data preprocessing before clustering
- Visualize and interpret clustering results
- Conduct cohort analysis on the full dataset

The goal is to gain experience in customer lifecycle management techniques like RFM analysis, customer segmentation, and cohort analysis.
